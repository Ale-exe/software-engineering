				<p class="teamText">From a young age, Findlay has always been known for his ability to communicate with people and appeal to an audience. As a result, it did not take long
				for Findlay to persuade both Alex Gwilliam and Toby Warren to join him in his task to make Norwich a safer place for everyone. Since founding the Norwich Testing Initiative,
				Findlay has been working closely with the government to build relations and awareness of the project, securing personal protective equiptment for the team.

				During website development, Findlay was primarily in charge of the backend functionality, creation of the design document, and work on the user guide.

				<p class="teamText">Alex has always cared about the safety of the people, not just those around him, and after hearing 
				the governments plan to get people tested, he decided to get together with team members Findlay and Toby in
				an attempt to lend a helping hand to a good cause.
				Since the creation of the Norwich Testing Initiative, Alex has worked at building awareness across the entire 
				city of Norwich with campaigns designed to encourage testing.  

				During website development, Alex was in charge of the creation and design of the Team Information page, the Form page and validation, 
				as well as the design of both the nav bar, and the footer section with contact details and links.

			<p class="teamText">Toby was a Computer Science student at the University of East Anglia when colleagues Alex Gwilliam
			and Findlay Anstruther-Norton approached him with an idea to further aid the situation and lend a helping hand towards a good cause.
			Toby's specialities lay in coding, and along with his colleagues, he helped design a functioning site that would allow 
			users to sign up with their personal details along with a specified date in order to book a personal COVID-19 test. 

			During website development, Toby was primarily in charge of the index page, documentation, and helping out with the back end system.
